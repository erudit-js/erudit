/**
 * Horizontal lines are used to separate prose content in places
 * where it is not possible to use headings or built-in block separators.
 *
 * Use with extra caution, as overuse of horizontal lines can make prose look cluttered!
 * When possible, prefer other means of content separation.
 *
 * @title Horizontal Line
 * @layout block
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <P>Paragraph 1</P>
 * <Hr />
 * <P>Paragraph 2</P>
 * ```
